# MIT-OCW-6.0001-PS3
In this problemset I code a word game where a player is dealt 7 letters and must come up with words made out of those letters.

This project contains my work done for MIT Opencourseware's class 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python, Problem Set 3. Included in addition to my code are the instructions for the problem set, tests (provided by the instructor) for the code, and a word.txt file that the game uses.
